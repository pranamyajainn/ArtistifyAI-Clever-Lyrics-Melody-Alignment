[Verse 1]
I've been drinking absinthe
I just did the math, it ain't adding up
I've had enough of running 'round this board game
You can know your own name, I won't give it up
[Pre-Chorus]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Am I stupid for playin' these games with you?
[Chorus]
If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flyin'
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm sayin'
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm stayin'
My two feet are in the sand
[Verse 2]
I've been readin' old shit and I can't make sense of it
Ain't no conspiracy that can save me
Livin' in the moment feels good to me till it hurts
And I need somebody[Pre-Chorus]
Am I crazy? Am I foolish?
Am I stupid for playin' these games with you?
[Chorus]
If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they'rе flyin'
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm sayin'
Just takе me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm stayin'
My two feet are in the sand
[Bridge]
Take me as I am
I'm tired of dancin' around the point
Sharp and it is jagged
Like the shape of glass and it steals my voice
[Chorus]
If I told you I loved you (Oh)
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flyin'
Would you say that you looked up? (Looked up)
Don't take me for what I'm sayin' (Don't)
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm stayin'
My two feet are in the sand[Outro]
If I told you I loved you
Would you say that it's fucked up?
If I told you they're flyin'
Would you say that you looked up?
Don't take me for what I'm sayin' (Ooh)
Just take me for what I am
'Cause this is where I'm stayin'
My two feet are in the sand
