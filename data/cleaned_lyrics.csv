Zayn Back To Life,"[Intro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
[Verse 1]
What if I changed my mind?
What if I said it's over?
I been flying so long
Can't remember what it was like to be sober
What if I lost my lives?
What if I said game over?
What if I forget my lines
And I lose all my composure?
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight
[Chorus]
I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life[Verse 2]
What if we never met?
What if I never saw her?
'Cause I've been burning up for so long
In a world that just keeps getting colder
[Pre-Chorus]
Honestly she's the only one that's watching over me
Gives me oxygen when it gets hard to breathe
And if I'm wrong or right
She's always on my side
And if I lose the fight

I know she'll bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life
Bring me back
Bring me back, bring me back to life

Zayn Befour,"[Intro]
I've done this before
Not like this
[Verse 1]
I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's somethin' I want
I'll take all the right wrongs now
I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of pickin' that bone
And I can't be bothered
To fight it no more, no
[Pre-Chorus]
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm livin' on a wire
Numb on a roof, set it on fire

So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say now

I've done this before
Not like this, not like this
[Verse 2]
Time for me to move up
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords
Into your song, no

Zayn Better,"[Verse 1]
Hope I only leave good vibes on your living room floor
It hurts so bad that I didn't when you asked for more
Your dad probably loves me more than he ever did now
'Cause I finally got out
Yeah, we finally knocked down
[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause sometimes it's better that way
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break
'Cause I love you
Yeah, baby, I love you
Just this one time, hear what I'm tryna say
Know you might not feel quite the same way
But I love you
I tell you, I love you
[Chorus]
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Oh, I say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm making you cry
Why wait to hate? Can we save love?
[Verse 2]
I fell in, I'm falling, I'm for you
I can't let you fall through the floor too
It's a gamble to take any more of you
(It's a gamble to take-take more you)
Still in my mind sometimes, I must admit it
Like it's a crime, on trial, I got acquitted
Me and you wasn't meant, we wasn't fitted
Like it's a glove, I hated to admit it[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause obviously, we go back
So why would we ruin that?
In too deep, we're rearranged
Now you wanna ask for names
We can't let this fruit go bad
Sayin' things we can't take back
In too deep, we're rearranged
Say you feel the same

Zayn Bright,"[Verse 1]
I found my life in between shots and getting high
The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again, yeah
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd

Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight

Load her like gigabyte

I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright

Always felt isolated, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I was so defensive
I'll find a way to let you in

Oh, I love it when you show, when you show
